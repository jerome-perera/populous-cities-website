    <h3>5: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico-City" target="_blank">Mexico City</a> (21.6 million)</h3>
    <p>
    	Situated between the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain ranges to the west and east respectively, the capital of Mexico is the largest city in North America. It was originally called Tenochtitlan under the Aztec tribe before 1521, when Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes conquered the city and renamed it to Mexico City. The scenery of Mexico City embraces both old and new, from colonial era churches to modern skyscrapers. Many of its inhabitants came from the surrounding countryside in search of work and an oppurtunity for a better life.

    <h3>4: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sao-Paulo-Brazil" target="_blank">Sao Paulo</a> (21.8 million)</h3>
    <p>
    	Located in the Brazilian Highlands close to the Atlantic Ocean in Southeast Brazil, Sao Paulo is the largest city in the Western and Southern Hemispheres. Sao Paulo was founded by Jesuit Missionaries in 1554 and was under Portuguese control until Brazil's independence in 1822. Sao Paulo started out as a minor city but grew as coffee became essential to Brazil's economy. This led to immigration from all parts of Europe, especially Italy. Sao Paulo is a much more modernized city in comparison to the rest of Brazil, and it is regarded as mainly the economic center of Brazil with less of a cultural vibe than its counterpart Rio de Janeiro. However, there is still much to see in Sao Paulo, with its towering skyscrapers and its mix of Portuguese, Italian, African, Asian and other diverse groups of people that add to the overall diversity of the city.

    <h3>3: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Shanghai" target="_blank">Shanghai</a> (26.3 million)</h3>
    <p>
    	Sitting on the east coast of China next to the East China Sea, China's largest city, Shanghai, is both a global financial hub and one of the largest shipping hubs in the world. Shanghai has long dominated China's trade since becoming one of the first Chinese ports to open to Western trade. However, after the communists took over in 1949, Shanghai became an industrial giant and was increasingly made to supply domestic industrial needs within China as China seeks to modernize itself. Air and water pollution have been major problems in recent years with all the industrial developments, although the city does boast beautiful skyscrapers such as the Shanghai World Financial Center building and the Shanghai Tower. Shanghai has a very homogenic population, with the vast majority of citizens being Han Chinese. However, the rapid modernization of Shanghai makes it an exciting prospect for tourism.

    <h3>2: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Delhi" target="_blank">Delhi</a> (29.3 million)</h3>
    <p>
    	Delhi consists of two sectors: Delhi, with the old sector containing pre-colonial era and colonial era buildings, and New Delhi, the new sector which is the capital of India. Delhi sits on the Yamuna River, a tributary of the Ganges River, which is central to Hindu religion and Indian culture. Over the centuries, Delhi has been the center of many different empires and kingdoms and has been held by rulers of many different religions and cultures. The city was so great that even Alexander the Great couldn't conquer it. Tourists visiting Delhi are able to witness the blend between old and new, ancient and modern, and the blend between the various religions in the area (Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, and Jainism among others)

    <h3>1: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Tokyo" target="_blank">Tokyo</a> (37.4 million)</h3>
    <p>
    	Located on the Pacific coast of the main island of Honshu in Japan, Tokyo is the largest city in the world! The city was once a humble fishing village until it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate in the 1600s under the name Edo. Tokyo is regarded as not only a financial, industrial, and commercial hub for Japan, but also as an international hub with a distinctive culture and tradition. One of the most famous sites in Tokyo is the Imperial Palace, where the emperor used to live. Tokyo was central to Japan's development as one of the first industrial nations in Asia, and its continued focus on technological advancement in appliances and transportation continue to amaze the world.
